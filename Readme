Open at first preprocessing.py .This will combine both results of Tagging Bi LSTM and Transformer tripels.It will also do some changes to data(realtions1.pkl should be created) . Then open project owlready.py to create the ontology. Then inside konclude folder in your system copy the scripts from Konclude here and the resulted test.owl ontology plus the GBO ontology(GENIALOntBFO). To reason with second method Open second_method_first_run.py then.py second_run to create two ontologies(test.owl for consistent ontology and test1.owl for inconsistent one).Rename the inconsistent ontology testi(test1) and place it in the main folder then open the finishing loop.py to change the csv file(tagging).
